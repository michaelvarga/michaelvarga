I am a full stack software engineer committed to building well-designed systems and engaging user experiences. I thrive in collaborative environments and embrace the challenge of learning new technologies.

I spent several years working in tech consulting where I gained valuable experience in project management, problem-solving, client-communication, and the delivery of software solutions to a diverse range of clients. My customer-focused mindset and strong communication skills makes me a stronger, more empathetic developer.
